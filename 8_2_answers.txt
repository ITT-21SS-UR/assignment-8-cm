“Avoiding pitfalls when using machine learning in HCI studies” (by Kostakos et al. [1])

What are some common use cases for machine learning in practical applications or research prototypes?
There are many use cases for studies with human subjects, such as activity recognition and wearable computing. 
Machine Learning (ML) is especially helpful if one wishes to model human behavior for Human Behavior Analyses. 
Also, for developing many User Interface Techniques, such as “to react to special user input (e.g. gesture recognition), 
optimizing system resources (e.g. smartphone battery conservation [[2]]), provide intelligent mobile notifications” [1] 
or to predict user’s future activities and interactions (with the aim to predict all).

Which problems of machine learning do the authors of the paper identify? 
The many risks one needs to be aware of to avoid pitfalls when using ML, a few of them are the following:
1. To evaluate the system the researcher should do and document both results, for one if only the user’s data was used 
and on the other side when the data of the whole population was used. Especially if the system requires data from other 
users to work for new first-time users. 
2. Sometimes clustering the users into user groups is necessary for correct predictions.
3. Depending on their complexity and dimensionality from the given data some classification methods, are much more 
difficult to interpret as other classic statistical methods would be.
4. ML techniques often give inside about correlations, but these are not necessarily also causalities
5. “Different techniques should be used in controlled vs. non-controlled experiments” [1], as non-controlled
Designs can be analyzed but one needs to be even more careful.
6. Classifiers with an accuracy above 80% are often considered variable, yet this accuracy also highly depends on the 
relative likelihood of the event that should be measured. Therefore, researchers should also report the baseline 
performance so one can differentiate between the two.
7. The impact of “false positives” (a finding is reported even though there is none) should be considered more often.
8. It is essential to know the used algorithm and the basics of machine learning when using it.

Explain one of them in detail:
“ML prediction accuracy cannot be used as substitute for classic hypothesis testing and correlation/causation analysis.” [1]
Most times, especially in context with the user’s behavior, qualitative data is very important to interpret quantitative
data, in such cases mixing different methods to obtain both are often needed. Yet applying ML techniques usually returns 
quantitative data. Some researchers use additional observation to achieve this, yet this can’t always be done (for example 
when a deep learning technique are used, in such cases much information about the used code should be documented). Given this 
the authors believe that one should first use normal hypothesis testing and then afterwards use ML for estimation and prediction.

What are the credentials of the authors with regard to machine learning? 
The paper is only 5 pages with cover page and sources. Given its shortness it doesn’t contain many references, only seven. 
Also, according to google scholar as well as ACM the paper ‘only’ got quoted nine times (state: 23.06.2021). 
According to his own page the author Mirco Musolesi has “Machine Learning” as one of his fields of interest. Also, after 
and before the paper appeared other papers using machine learning are and were created.

Have they published research on machine learning (or using machine-learning techniques) previously?
Before that they had no paper with machine learning as main topic, but both had many papers where it was used.
For example, Vassilis Kostakos used machine learning to gain information from social media for an emergency response system [3] 
and improving situational awareness in such a case [4], to model traffic patterns in an urban environment [5], to classify gaps 
in the daily usage of the smartphone [6] or to improve observation methods of the live of medical patients [7].
Mirco Musolesi also released the paper “Interpretable machine learning for mobile notification management: An overview of prefminer” [8] 
in the same month. He previously had released a paper where he suggested many possible predictions with ML and data of mobile phones [9] 
for people-centric sensing [10]. He further used ML to inform researchers and therapists with assessments of a person’s mental state [11] 
Both have many more research papers published where they used ML.
